# TNF-alpha_Tay_MATLAB_Simulation
Edited MATLAB code from Savas Tay paper 'Single-cell NF-?B dynamics reveal 
digital activation and analogue information processing' (2010). Files with 
'New' suffix are edited, more easily used documents. Suffix 'Modified' 
indicates an intermediate document for use in streamlining other related 
documents. The new code is well commented, preamble described, and capable 
of functioning without other workspaces.
